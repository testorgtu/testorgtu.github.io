      The third minor release of AsciiDocsy refactors the entire theme as a proper Ruby gem!
      Now you can modify and extend AsciiDocsy while staying in-sync with the upstream releases.
      There is some disruption involved -- see <</docs/theme/setup/upgrade-0-3-0#,Upgrading to 0.3.0>> for full details.

        summ: Repackaged theme as Ruby gem
        tags: [breaking]
        note: |
          AsciiDocsy can now be installed as a gem.
          Add it to your Gemfile under `:jekyll_plugins` and indicate the theme in the `site.theme` parameter.
          See the docs for details.

        summ: Moved docs-site definitions to separate repo
        note: |
          While the source of AsciiDocsy technical documentation remains in the AsciiDocsy theme repo under `_docs/`, and the attributes-data source has moved to `lib/asciidocsy/data/`, the files that configure the AsciiDocsy documentation deployment have moved to a distinct repo.

          This move was mainly to model a proper docs-as-code deployment chain for the AsciiDocsy docs themselves.
          The AsciiDocsy theme repository is treated as a Git submodule of that documentation repo, so the docs repo always has ready access to the documentation and data directories of the subject repo.

          The new repo is at: {theme_docs_repo_www}

        summ: Added ReleaseHx "`release history`" templates
        note: |
          AsciiDocsy provides a templates and a YAML format for generating release notes and/or a changelog.
          If you are reading this as HTML or PDF, you are most likely looking at one such generated release history, for AsciiDocsy itself.
          Documentation is forthcoming; this feature may change without notice prior to 1.0.

            part: frontend
            summ: Removed Iconic from skins selection list
            note: |
              Because the Iconic skin imposed an ugly box under the page header that was not obviously fixable, Iconic will no longer be an option for users to select in the AsciiDocsy demo site skin changer.
              The Iconic skin source itself may be removed as early as v0.3.0.
              Mostly this note was just an excuse to use the `deprecation` tag, also added in this release.

            summ: Fixed Docs link feature in Changelog entries
            note: |
              Changelog entries with one and only one doc link will now hyperlink directly to that doc URL.
              Those with 2 or more doc entries still link to the Release Note entry for the same change, but now all changes with 2+ doc entries will always appear under Release Notes, even if they have no `note` property, so their multiple docs links can appear.

      This first release of AsciiDocsy has a long way to go, but it is already more mature than many Jekyll docs themes.
