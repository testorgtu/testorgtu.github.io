This site works great on Windows 10, and probably on Windows 7, and likely even on Windows XP.
Windows often requires extra/special instructions for developer-oriented stuff.

Windows users are encouraged to explore WSL2 for access to a true Unix-like system right inside their main OS.

This site was built on a Linux desktop, and it probably looks great on FreeBSD.
I personally want Mac and Windows users to know that, but other stuff might be noise to non-Linux users, so why rub their noses in it?

The author of AsciiDocsy strongly prefers Unix-like systems, but they would never want Windows users to see such a statement.
