= Version Handlers

Version handlers are front-end features that enable site users to see only the content that applies to their product version, role, use case, environment, preference, or other condition.
You can use version handlers however you want, but we present here some guidance for choosing among the options to suit your application.
Further topics detail the configuration of each handler type.

Handlers are named for their duty, not the form their controllers take.
The handler types perform distinct actions on the selected jQuery JavaScript `ready`, `change`, `focus`, or similar event.

[NOTE]
You do not need to know JavaScript or jQuery to implement handlers.
AsciiDocsy pre-customizes and extends Bootstrap features to provide configuration-based adaptation to your use case.

The rest of this topic provides an overview of attributes and functions common across version handlers as well as a guide for choosing between the various handler types.

== Version Handler Verbs

Version handlers are named for _what they do_, not what they look like.
For instance, the user can _swap_ tokens, _tab_ through a set of content blocks, _toggle_ classes to show/hide, or _amend_ the HTML document object model (DOM).
These labels are imperfect, but they allow us to distinguish _function_ from _form_.

=== _Tab_ Block Content in Place

Most common with code listings and log samples, [.case]*_if you need to alternate versions of content inside a fixed block_* without forcing the user to scroll, your optimal solution is *tabbing*.

These handlers use JavaScript to glean combinations of selector *tabs* and content *panes* out of the HTML rendered from conventional AsciiDoc syntax.

[[data-formats-listing]]
.Tabbed panes sourced entirely as AsciiDoc
====
include::{path_to_snippets}/example_tabset-source.adoc[tags=raw]
====

Any tabset or tab/pane class that is repeated throughout a page (and the rest of the site if cookies are enabled) will pre-select the last-chosen tab until altered by the user.

<</docs/theme/config/versioning/tabsets#,Learn more about pane tabs>>.

=== _Toggle_ Classes

Sometimes you need a combination of tabsets and swaps, [.case]*_alternating and muting larger blocks or shorter strings of text throughout a page_*.
A *toggle* lets you show elements of one class while hiding the rest of the classes in a group.

.Give it a try!
====
In the sidebar to your right is a set of buttons labeled with the three most popular families of operating systems.

Toggle through them and see the content change here.

[horizontal]
Operating System:: [.os-win]*Windows* [.os-mac]*MacOS* [.os-nix]*Linux*
Unix-like?:: [.os-win]#False# [.os-mac.os-nix]#True#
====

If inline content or various parts of an entire page need to be customized for user experience, apply classes ("`roles`" in AsciiDoc parlance) to the content.

Toggles are centrally defined in the Jekyll config, but you choose which pages the controllers appear on.

<</docs/theme/config/versioning/toggles#,Dive deeper into toggles.>>

=== _Swap_ Tokens in Place

In some cases, [.case]*_one simple string needs to be altered in numerous parts of a page_*, but it makes no sense to generate a whole version of the docs just to display this alternate content.
A *swap* changes the value of tokenized content throughout the page.

This feature is most commonly used to alter patch-revision numbers, such as in product-download paths and installation instructions.
Drop something like `+++[.tok.vrsn]*0.2.0*+++` into your page, and watch the version change as you switch between versions using the buttons to the right, below the table of contents: [.tok.vrsn]*0.2.0*.

Swaps can be user triggered by a radio button set or a selectbox.

==== Swap Token Slates

[.case]*_If you have more than one string to swap when a version changes_*, use token slates.
This capability could be invaluable to the process of "`white labeling`" a docset.
Replace key terms related to your or a customer's company, brand, or specific implementation of your product.

Token sets are defined in data files and can be swapped using buttons or selectboxes.

<</docs/theme/config/versioning/swaps#,See the swaps configuration page for examples.>>

=== _Amend_ URLs, Head Links, Anything in the DOM

When you need to go big, *version-dommer.html* is your tool.
At this time, Dommers can *_target the browser's location (URL) or any element in the current page's HTML5 DOM_*.

Taking the form of a selectbox or buttons, amenders are like an open-ended token swapper, targeting any discrete aspect of an HTML element that you can latch onto with jQuery.

The AsciiDocsy skin selectors are examples of changers that target CSS link refs in the header.
If you have not yet played with the theme skin changers that are in the right-hand sidebar throughout this site, select an alternative theme skin and review this same page.
Alternatively, choose a syntax skin and take another look at our <<data-formats-listing,YAML and JSON data listings>>.

These cases alter a CSS filename, but other functions are available.
Any system that changes URLs between docsets (substantial versioning) would use this handler to bump locations to a parallel revision directory.

A DOM amender toggle could also be used to switch between the light and dark themes of a website.

== Establishing & Overriding Defaults

All version handlers respect the same cascade hierarchy for establishing active options.

Every handler plants a cookie on the visiting browser so their choice is recalled for subsequent URLs during the session or until they clear their cookies.
This cookie becomes the effective, overriding default until another choice is actively made by the user (or a until link sends them to a URL that alters the choice).

In their configuration, every handler gets a *`pick:` parameter* to set the base system default.
If no `pick:` property exists or if the value is not an option, the *first option* will be selected by default.

If a *query string parameter* is provided in the URL, it will override any system default or cookie.
Query strings are formatted as `?<handler-id>=<option-slug>[&<handler-id>=<option-slug>]`.

.Try it out!
====
Use the following URL to pre-select options on this very page and anywhere else the same set of tab classes is used in the site.

link:?user-os-toggle=os-nix&data-format-tabber=data-json[]
====

Any time a *user selects* (or a URL determines) an option, that option becomes active and the cookie is instantly updated.

[WARNING]
If you use `form: none`, no controller will appear to enable users to change versions from within the page, and only a URL change will make or alter a version choice.
Tempting as this capability may seem, *NOTE* that it is _not_ a secure way to hide information from end users.
The code decrypted by their browser will contain all of the alternate options they are not seeing on the front end.

[NOTE]
By AsciiDocsy 1.0, an additional means of overriding a default option will include the domain or CNAME (subdomain) that is calling the page, so nothing as obvious as a `?parameter=value` need be used.
