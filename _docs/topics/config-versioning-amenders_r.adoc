= DOM Amenders

By far the most open-ended of the superficial version handlers, DOM amenders enable you to manipulate the DOM in one simple way at a time.
Not a wide-open API like jQuery itself, but a simple way to execute a jQuery function on the `change()` event.

Use cases include switching URLs or switching CSS files in the HTML `<head>`.

== Configuring a DOM Amender

To create a straightforward amender, make an entry in `site.features.versioning` and give it a [.param]`verb: amend` property.
The key property for an amender is the `func:` object.
This property must contain the `name:` of a <<built-in-amenders,built-in function>> or a `file:` to designate a <<custom-amender,custom JavaScript snippet>>.

=== Built-in Amender Functions

The existing named functions are:

change-url::
Alters the browser location.
Requires the `href:` property for passing a URL to which to send the browser.

change-href::
Alters the path of a resource file's source.
Requires an element to target (`targ:`) and a URL path to replace the token with.

The `href:` property in a built-in function can include Liquid syntax as well as JavaScript syntax.
Liquid will be executed at build-time; JavaScript will be executed in the browser.

Here is the source of the syntax skin changer in the right-hand sidebar.

<1> The `targ:` property accepts a String in the form of a link:https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/[jQuery selector] determining the element to act upon.

<2> The syntax `>-` designates that the String value should be trimmed of internal newlines and surrounding whitespace.
This is helpful when passing Liquid or other syntax intended for rendering inline.

=== Your Own DOM Amender Function

AsciiDocsy provides two key components to establish this functionality.
The first is the *formfield elements* populated by an array and defined by other settings, as with other version handlers.

The *version-handler.html* partial can generate generate either a `select` dropdown or radio `buttons`.
Pass it an [.term]*array* of [.term.scalar]*scalars* to establish the displayed option and the underlying value as one and the same.
Pass an array of dictionary objects bearing `text` and `slug` properties, and it will use these values for the option _labels_ and _values_, respectively.

To register your own DOM amender, add a template file (`.html` or `.js`) to the `_includes/` directory, and register it as the `func.file:` value inside your amender block.

.Example custom amender definition
[source,yaml]
----
  versioning:
    ...
    my-amender:
      verb: amend
      form: select
      func:
        file: my-amender.js
      swap:
        data: site.data.my-array
        pick: some-value
----

Your handler will be interpreted by `_includes/versioning-controls.html` and the controller will be generated by `_includes/version-handlers.html`.

It is called from within a `$(function(){` call that executes as the page loads.

[NOTE]
This functionality is likely to change by AsciiDocsy v1.0.
The JS will be captured inline and expressed in the tail of the document to move it out of the HTML.
