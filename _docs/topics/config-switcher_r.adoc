= Configure Content Switchers

Content switchers are a means of showing and hiding specific content on a page.
The content being switched can come in groups (where switching one _on_ turns others _off_), or a switcher can perform a single show/hide toggle of a group of content.

== Example Switcher

The next line is rendered differently depending on which button is selected in the page's *switcher to the right*.

[.os-win]
--
This content is for Windows Only.
--

[.os-nix]
--
This content is for Linux Only.
--

[.os-mac]
--
This content is for MacOS Only.
--

Switching can even happen inline, with a term like [.os-win]*Microsoft* [.os-mac]*Apple* [.os-nix]*open source*.

== Use Cases

Aside from enabling users to choose their platform, as with operating systems in the above example, switchers can be used for for [.term]*patch-revision handling*.

== Toggle Configuration
